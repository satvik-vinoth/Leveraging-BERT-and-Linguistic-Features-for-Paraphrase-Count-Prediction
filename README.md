# Leveraging BERT and Linguistic Features for Paraphrase Count Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the number of paraphrases a sentence can generate using a custom BERT-based regression model enhanced with linguistic features. The project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for paraphrase generation, feature extraction, and model training.

## Features
- **Generate paraphrases** using the **PEGASUS** model.
- **Extract linguistic features** such as:
  - Part-of-Speech (POS) tags.
  - Dependency structures.
  - Readability scores.
- **Train a BERT-based regression model** to predict paraphrase counts for a given sentence.
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - **RÂ²** (Coefficient of Determination)
  - **MSE** (Mean Squared Error)
  - **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**.

## Outputs
The project generates the following outputs:
 - Training and Validation Loss Curves: Visualized to track model performance over epochs.
 - Feature Importance: Visualized as a bar chart to show the impact of linguistic features.
 - Predicted vs. Actual Paraphrase Counts: Scatter plot to compare predictions with ground truth.
 - Metrics: Final evaluation metrics (RÂ², MSE, Precision, Recall, and F1-score).
